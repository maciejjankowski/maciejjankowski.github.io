# The Architecture of Conscious Living: My Journey from Self-Sabotage to Self-Mastery

*It was 1 AM in Warsaw when Gaciej and I stumbled upon the most important conversation of our lives. What started as a casual podcast recording became a three-hour deep dive into the mechanics of human consciousness—and accidentally, we discovered principles that aligned with the most cutting-edge research in psychology, neuroscience, and quantum physics.*

This is my story of that night, and how it changed everything.

## The Washing Machine Revelation: When I Finally Understood My Life

I was telling Gaciej about something that had been haunting me for years. At 27, I had been the person I wanted to be. I had written down exactly who I wanted to become, and **every single goal materialized**—except one I forgot to specify clearly. Money flowing like water, incredible mood, euphoria dripping through every day like honey.

"Stary, I was literally a human embodiment of euphoria," I told him, my voice catching with the memory.

But then I made the mistake that would plague me for the next 15 years: I assumed the "program" would run forever without maintenance.

"It's like a washing machine," I explained to Gaciej, the metaphor crystallizing in real-time. "You load the program, it runs, cleans everything, then stops. You need to load the next program. But I just... forgot to reload it."

What I didn't realize that night was that I was accidentally describing one of the most powerful findings in behavioral psychology. Dr. Emily van Sonnenberg's groundbreaking UCLA study would later show that students who wrote down their daily intentions achieved their goals **92% more often** than those who didn't. But my experience went deeper than goal-setting—I was living proof of what psychologists call "implementation intentions."[^1]

### My Personal Programming Breakthrough

Sitting in that car, I realized I had been unconsciously running other people's programs for years. Instagram in the morning instead of meditation. Netflix instead of creative work. The cultural programming of endless distractions instead of my carefully crafted vision.

"Kim chcesz być?" Gaciej asked me. "Who do you want to be?"

"That's the hardest question you can ask anyone," I replied, but I knew he was right. I had asked it at 14 and written in my diary: **"True freedom is imposing limitations on yourself."** At 27, I lived by that principle. At 41, driving through Warsaw, I realized I needed to ask it again.

Research from Peter Gollwitzer shows that when people create specific "if-then" plans, they're 200-300% more likely to follow through. But I had learned something deeper: **you need to consciously choose your constraints, then keep choosing them, every single day**.[^1]

## The Lottery Win That Taught Me About Sharp Vision

I told Gaciej a story I'd never fully processed. At 27, during my peak period, I spent £800 on lottery tickets at Heathrow Airport. Every single day for a month, I visualized winning.

The call came on a beautiful afternoon. "Is this Mr. Mieszko Kępka from Poland?"

"Yes, that's me."

"You didn't win the grand prize, but we have a consolation prize for you."

One hundred thousand pounds.

"I was on the vibration of a nice car," I explained to Gaciej. "That's what I wanted. A car."

But here's where I learned the most expensive lesson about visualization: **specificity matters**. The lottery offered an Audi R8 or a Porsche GT3 RS. I couldn't decide. My vision was blurry.

"Young sorceress, the vision is unclear," I joked, but the pain was real. "When you don't have sharp vision, it derails you completely."

Dr. Judd Biasiotto's research on basketball players proves this scientifically: players who combined physical practice with detailed mental visualization improved their free-throw percentage by 23%, compared to 14% for those who only practiced physically. The brain cannot distinguish between a vividly imagined experience and a real one—but it can tell the difference between sharp focus and vague hoping.[^2]

**Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone's Harvard research** using brain imaging showed that people who practiced piano scales mentally developed the same motor cortex changes as those who practiced physically. My lottery experience was accidental proof of this principle.

But I learned something else: I was afraid of my own success.

## The Pattern That Nearly Destroyed Me

"You know what happened with that lottery money?" I asked Gaciej, my voice getting quieter.

"What happened?"

"I spent it all. Every penny. And it wasn't even on stupid things—it was on the fear of having it."

This was the moment I understood what Dr. Gay Hendricks calls "Upper Limit Problems". Most of us have an unconscious thermostat for how much success, love, or happiness we believe we deserve. When we exceed this limit, we unconsciously sabotage ourselves.[^3]

I told Gaciej about the music equipment. Twenty years ago, I held a Korg Electribe sampler in my hands. Had the money. Wanted it desperately. Could have learned music production, maybe changed my whole creative life.

"And I broke," I admitted. "Right at the moment when everything was possible."

Later, with a synthesizer worth \$2,000: "I looked at it, fell in love with it, had the money—and broke again."

"The horses are hitched, the carriage is ready," I said, using our metaphor, "and I break down at exactly those moments."

Dr. Brené Brown's research on shame shows this pattern stems not from guilt about what you've done, but shame about who you are. The antidote isn't positive thinking but what she calls "shame resilience": recognizing the pattern and choosing differently.[^3]

But Gaciej challenged my story.

## The Friend Who Wouldn't Let Me Stay in Victim Mode

"Listen," Gaciej interrupted, "maybe those weren't lost moments. Maybe those were the times you stopped meditating to gather ingredients for your vision. To gather experience."

I bristled. "You sound like my therapist. I don't like it."

"Good," he shot back. "Because that's your problem. That's your inner child. If you're so convinced it was wasted time, our band isn't going to play. I want to release this album."

This moment captured something crucial about transformation: **you need people who won't enable your victim stories**. Research on codependency shows that the healthiest thing you can do is set boundaries, even with friends trying to help.[^4]

"You take care of yourself," Gaciej continued, "and I'll take care of myself. You have no influence over other people. Only over yourself."

He was right. In 12-step therapy, they teach that you can tell one person "you look beautiful" and get a hug and a kiss. You can tell another person the same thing and get kicked in the shin because they hadn't washed their hair. **You have no control over their response**.

## The Quantum Revelation

Then Gaciej brought up something that blew my mind: the double-slit experiment.

"You know that experiment where an electron goes through two slits?" he asked.

"Yeah, something like that."

"When no one's watching, you get the interference pattern—the electron goes through both slits like a wave. But the moment you put an observer there to see which slit it goes through, it chooses one slit and behaves like a particle."

The implications hit me like lightning. "So if observation affects reality in quantum physics," I said, "then observation also affects the reality we see here."

Recent research by the Weizmann Institute created microscopic "observers" and found that **the level of observation directly correlates with the degree of change** in particle behavior. Dr. K. Onggadinata's 2024 research introduces "quasi-probabilities" to better understand how observation affects quantum systems.[^5][^6]

"Universe is mental," I whispered.

"Reality is primarily non-material, then material," Gaciej agreed.

Whether or not quantum effects directly influence daily life, decades of research on expectation, attention, and belief show that **where you place your mental focus literally changes what you experience**.

## The Book That Explained Everything

"Remember 'The Four Agreements'?" I asked Gaciej.

"Yeah, great book."

"Don Miguel Ruiz says you're either living your own dream or someone else's dream. But you're always living some dream."

This connected everything. My peak period at 27: my dream. The years of drift afterward: other people's dreams. Instagram's dream. Netflix's dream. The consumer culture's dream.

The conversation reminded me of business manifestation stories I'd lived through. Thinking about business systems for years, then getting a call from a friend: "We're building a startup, want to join?" Walking into it "completely in white"—completely ready.

Dr. Joseph Murphy's "The Power of Your Subconscious Mind" documents thousands of similar cases. The mechanism isn't mystical—it's about **persistent background processing that primes you to recognize opportunities when they appear**.

## The Cultural Shame I Had to Overcome

We talked about why people don't create art or music, and I realized I'd been carrying cultural shame about authentic expression.

"Primitive cultures sing and dance without self-consciousness," I told Gaciej. "Modern shame around creation is cultural conditioning."

Evan Wood's research for the Association of Colleges found that art education often enforces **"dominant standards of beauty, skill, and worth"** rather than encouraging authentic expression. I'd internalized this as: "Don't show who you really are unless it meets external standards."[^7]

But driving through Warsaw at 1 AM, recording our raw conversation, I felt something shift. This **was** creation. This **was** authentic expression. And it felt more real than anything I'd produced trying to meet external standards.

## The Framework I'm Building Now

By 3 AM, we'd outlined a complete system for conscious living:

**1. Write Your Program Consciously** - Document exactly who you want to be, with the specificity of a software engineer writing code.[^1]

**2. Choose Your Constraints** - Pick your limitations consciously rather than having them imposed by others.[^8]

**3. Visualize With Surgical Precision** - Not vague hoping, but detailed mental rehearsal that creates neural pathways.[^2]

**4. Recognize Self-Sabotage Patterns** - Especially the moment when "the horses are hitched" and you want to run.[^3]

**5. Set Radical Boundaries** - Take responsibility only for yourself, not other people's reactions.[^4]

**6. Reload Your Program Regularly** - Like a washing machine, consciousness programs need intentional maintenance.

Now, months after that conversation, I'm living differently. I've written my new program. I practice sharp visualization daily. When I catch myself running someone else's mental software, I reload my own.

The research validates what Gaciej and I discovered that night: **you are the architect of your own reality**. The question isn't whether this is true—neuroscience, psychology, and quantum physics all point in the same direction.

The question is: **Are you ready to take conscious control of the program running your life?**

Because at 1 AM in Warsaw, I finally was.
