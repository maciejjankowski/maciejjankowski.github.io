**Email Validation** Why Do Websites Keep Getting It Wrong? (It's Not Just the Developers)

**_It's incredibly frustrating to encounter websites that refuse to acknowledge your perfectly valid email address. You wonder, how can something as fundamental as email validation still be a widespread problem? While it's easy to blame developers, the underlying issues are often more systemic._**

**The Pressures Behind Bad Email Validation**

While developers ultimately write the code, the reasons for overly strict or misguided email validation rules frequently stem from broader forces within development environments:

- **Misinformed Expectations:** Project managers, stakeholders, or even developers themselves might have inaccurate ideas about what constitutes a "valid" email address, based on outdated standards or limited experience.
- **Short Deadlines:** Rushed development cycles leave little time for researching email standards or carefully crafting validation rules. The priority becomes getting it to 'work' rather than getting it right.
- **Lack of Open Discussion:** Without open channels for developers to question requirements or suggest better approaches, flawed assumptions about email validation can easily slip through.
- **Code Review Oversights:** Even with code reviews in place, the nuances of email validation can be missed if reviewers aren't specifically looking for these issues or aren't well-versed in email standards themselves.
  _maybe the senior is not senior enough_
- **Lax Quality Standards:** When the overall emphasis is on speed of delivery over thoroughness and user-friendliness, validation corners are likely to be cut.

**The Pernicious Problem of the '+' Sign (and More)**

The confusion around plus signs (+) in emails is a perfect example of how systemic factors lead to bad validation. Many organizations are unaware of the legitimate uses of these characters permitted by popular email providers. This translates to needless restrictions for users.

**It's Not About Bad Developers**

It's important to understand that most developers aren't deliberately trying to create frustrating validation experiences. However, the environment they operate within can heavily influence the final outcome.

**Shifting the Focus for Better Validation**

To address the widespread problems with incorrect email validation, we need to broaden the conversation:

1. **Educate Beyond Developers:** Target education about email standards to include project managers and stakeholders who define requirements.
   _maybe your stakeholders are not the best UI designers?_
2. **Build in Time for Questioning:** Encourage a culture where developers can raise concerns about potentially restrictive validation without being seen as blockers.
3. **Prioritize Code Review:** Make email validation an explicit point of attention during code reviews.
4. **Elevate User Experience:** Cultivate a company-wide understanding that overly strict validation doesn't equal security. A focus on user experience reduces frustration across the board.

**A Call for Collaboration and User-Focused Development**

While developers play a key role, lasting improvements in email validation will come from addressing the environment in which they work. By promoting education, open communication, and attention to user experience, we can make the web a more welcoming and inclusive space for everyone, regardless of their email address format.

**Culture shifts worth exploring**:

- **Code reviews** where emphasis is placed on user experience and accessibility. It is worth asking what are company's principles that should be followed. What are we aiming at? Is this more about high-quality and low-maintenance code or is it accepting good-enough code while pushing the deadlines. Is the reviewer senior enough to catch the seemingly innocent mistakes turning into technical debt, UI nuissance or worse, potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Mentoring program** where developers can learn from senior developers about best practices. This one is often overlooked while companies often seem to believe that knowledge transfer is only the developer's responsibility and the initiative should come bottom-up.
- **Lack of systemic career paths for developers** which can lead to developers feeling left on their own and in the dark about how to improve their skills and knowledge. The solution could be to create a more structured career path with clear milestones and opportunities for growth.
